    <h3><b>Web design</b></h3><p> is the planning and creation of websites. This includes the information architecture, user interface, site structure, navigation, layout, colors, fonts, and imagery. All of these are combined with the principles of design to create a website that meets the goals of the owner and designer. Design is a key part of web design. This includes both the design principles: balance, contrast,emphasis, rhythm, and unity and the design elements: lines, shapes, texture, colour, and direction.  <b>Web development</b> is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design, web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, <b>web development</b> usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing markup and coding.</p>

    <h3>Software development</h3>(also known as <b>application development, software design, designing software, software application development,enterprise application development, or platform development</b>) <p> is the development of a <b>software product</b>. The term <b>software development</b> may be used to refer to the activity of <b>computer programming</b>, which is the process of writing and maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process.[2] Therefore, <b>software development</b> may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in <b>software products</b>.  Software can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being to meet specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with <b>custom software</b>), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential users (the case with <b>commercial</b> and <b>open source software</b>), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist may write software to automate a mundane task). <b>Embedded software development</b>, that is, the development of <b>embedded software</b> such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the <b>development process</b> to be integrated with the development of the controlled physical product.  The need for better <b>quality control</b> of the <b>software development process</b> has given rise to the discipline of <b>software engineering</b>, which aims to apply the systematic approach exemplified in the <b>engineering</b> paradigm to the process of <b>software development</b>.</p>
    <h3>Custom software</h3><p>(also known as <b>bespoke software or tailor made software</b>) is software that is specially developed for some specific organization or other user. As such, it can be contrasted with the use of software packages developed for the mass market, such as <b>commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software</b>, or existing free software, an in-house software development group, or be commissioned from an external <b>software development company</b>.  Since <b>custom software</b> is developed for a single customer it can accommodate particular preferences and expectations of customer. Custom software may be designed in stage by stage processes, allowing all nuances and possible hidden dangers to be taken into account, including issues which were not mentioned in the specifications. Especially the first phase in the software development process may involve many departments, including marketing, engineering, research and development and general management.  Large companies commonly use custom software for critical functions, including <b>content management, inventory management, customer management, human resource management</b>, or otherwise to fill the gaps present in the existing software packages. Often such software is <b>legacy software</b>, developed before COTS software packages offering the required functionality became available.</p>
    <h3>Search engine optimization (SEO)</h3> <p>is the process of affecting the visibility of a <b>website or a web page</b> in a search engine's "natural" or un-paid ("organic") search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. <b>SEO</b> may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines. As an <b>Internet marketing</b> strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic.</p>
